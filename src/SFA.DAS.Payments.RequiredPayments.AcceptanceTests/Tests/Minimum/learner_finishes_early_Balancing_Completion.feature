Feature: Provider earnings and payments where learner completes earlier than planned

    #The earnings and payment rules for early completions are the same as for learners finishing on time, except that the completion payment is earned earlier.

Background:

	Given the current processing period is 13
	#Given the apprenticeship funding band maximum for each learner is 20000

	And the following learners:
	| LearnRefNumber | Ukprn | ULN   |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | 10000 |

	And the following course information:
	| AimSeqNumber | ProgrammeType | FrameworkCode | PathwayCode | StandardCode | FundingLineType                                                       | LearnAimRef | LearningStartDate | LearningPlannedEndDate | LearningActualEndDate | CompletionStatus |
