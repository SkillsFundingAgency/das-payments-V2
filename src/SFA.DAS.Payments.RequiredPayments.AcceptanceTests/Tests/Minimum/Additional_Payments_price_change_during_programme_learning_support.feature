Scenario Outline: Contract Type 2 On programme payments

	And the following historical contract type 2 on programme payments exist:   
	| LearnRefNumber | Ukprn | PriceEpisodeIdentifier | Period | ULN   | TransactionType    | Amount   |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1				      | 1      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1				      | 2      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1				      | 3      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |

	When a TOBY is received

	Then the payments due component will generate the following contract type 2 payable earnings:
	| LearnRefNumber | Ukprn | PriceEpisodeIdentifier | Period | ULN   | TransactionType    | Amount   |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1                     | 1      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1                     | 2      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1                     | 3      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |

	Examples: 
	| transaction_type | amount |
	| Learning_1       | 750    |


Scenario Outline: Contract Type 2 On programme payments changed price

	And the following historical contract type 2 on programme payments exist:

	| learnref1      | 10000 | p2				      | 4      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |

	When a TOBY is received

	Then the payments due component will generate the following contract type 2 payable earnings:
	| LearnRefNumber | Ukprn | PriceEpisodeIdentifier | Period | ULN   | TransactionType    | Amount   |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p2                     | 4      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |
