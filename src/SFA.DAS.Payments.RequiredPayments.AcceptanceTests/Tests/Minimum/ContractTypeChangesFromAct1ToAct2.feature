	And the following historical contract type 1 on programme payments exist:   
	| LearnRefNumber | Ukprn | PriceEpisodeIdentifier | Period | ULN   | TransactionType    | Amount   |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1                     | 1      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |

	When a TOBY is received

	Then the payments due component will generate the following contract type 1 payable earnings:
	| LearnRefNumber | Ukprn | PriceEpisodeIdentifier | Period | ULN   | TransactionType    | Amount    |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1                     | 1      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount>  |
