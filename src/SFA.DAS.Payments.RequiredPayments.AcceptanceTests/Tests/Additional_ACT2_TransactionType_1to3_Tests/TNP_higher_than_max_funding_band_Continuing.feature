Feature: TNP is higher than the maximum funding band, continuing
#Reduced on program funding as per band maximum - 600 instead of 1000

Background:
	Given the current processing period is 3
	And the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 9000

	And the following learners:
	| LearnRefNumber | Ukprn | ULN   |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | 10000 |

	And the following course information:
	| AimSeqNumber | ProgrammeType | FrameworkCode | PathwayCode | StandardCode | FundingLineType                                                       | LearnAimRef | LearningStartDate | LearningPlannedEndDate | LearningActualEndDate | CompletionStatus |
	| 1            | 2             | 403           | 1           |              | 16-18 Apprenticeship (From May 2017) Non-Levy Contract (non-procured) | ZPROG001    | 06/08/2017        | 20/08/2018             | 20/08/2018            | completion       |

	And the following contract type 2 on programme earnings for periods 1-11 are provided in the latest ILR for the academic year 1718:
	| PriceEpisodeIdentifier | EpisodeStartDate | EpisodeEffectiveTNPStartDate | TotalNegotiatedPrice | Learning_1 |
	| p1                     | 06/08/2017       | 06/08/2017                   | 15000                | 600        |

Scenario Outline: Contract Type 2 On programme payments

	And the following historical contract type 2 on programme payments exist:   
	| LearnRefNumber | Ukprn | PriceEpisodeIdentifier | Period | ULN   | TransactionType    | Amount   |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1                     | 1      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1                     | 2      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |

	When a TOBY is received

	Then the payments due component will generate the following contract type 2 payable earnings:
	| LearnRefNumber | Ukprn | PriceEpisodeIdentifier | Period | ULN   | TransactionType    | Amount   |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1                     | 1      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1                     | 2      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1                     | 3      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |
	
	Examples: 
	| transaction_type | amount |
	| Learning_1       | 600    |

#	Scenario: 640-AC02-Payment for a non-DAS learner with a negotiated price above the funding band cap
#    Given the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 15000
#    When an ILR file is submitted with the following data:
#        | Provider   | ULN       | learner type           | agreed price | start date | planned end date | actual end date | completion status | standard code |
#        | provider a | learner a | programme only non-DAS | 18000        | 06/08/2017 | 08/08/2018       |                 | continuing        | 50            |
#    Then the following capping will apply to the price episodes:
#        | Provider   | price episode | negotiated price | funding cap | previous funding paid | price above cap | effective price for SFA payments |
#        | provider a | 08/17 onwards | 18000            | 15000       | 0                     | 3000            | 15000                            |
