Feature: 807_AC1- Non-DAS learner, is made redundant within the last 6 months of planned learning - receives full government funding for the rest of the programme 
#What will be the learner status after 12 months

Background:
	Given the current processing period is 12

	And the following learners:
	| LearnRefNumber | Ukprn | ULN   |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | 10000 |

	And the following course information:
	| AimSeqNumber | ProgrammeType | FrameworkCode | PathwayCode | StandardCode | FundingLineType                                                       | LearnAimRef | LearningStartDate | LearningPlannedEndDate | LearningActualEndDate | CompletionStatus |
	| 1            | 2             | 403           | 1           |              | 16-18 Apprenticeship (From May 2017) Non-Levy Contract (non-procured) | ZPROG001    | 03/08/2017        | 20/08/2018             |                       | continuing       |

	And the employment status in the ILR is:
    | Employer     | Employment Status      | Employment Status Applies |
    | EmployerRef1 | in paid employment     | 02/08/2017                |
    |              | not in paid employment | 21/02/2018                |

	And the following contract type 2 on programme earnings for periods 1-12 are provided in the latest ILR for the academic year 1718:
	| PriceEpisodeIdentifier | EpisodeStartDate | EpisodeEffectiveTNPStartDate | TotalNegotiatedPrice | Learning_1 |
	| p1                     | 03/08/2017       | 03/08/2017                   | 15000                | 1000       |

Scenario Outline: Contract Type 2 On programme payments

	And the following historical contract type 2 on programme payments exist:   
	| LearnRefNumber | Ukprn | PriceEpisodeIdentifier | Period | ULN   | TransactionType    | Amount   |
	| learnref1      | 10000 | p1                     | 1      | 10000 | <transaction_type> | <amount> |

	When a TOBY is received

	Then the payments due component will generate the following contract type 2 payable earnings:
	| LearnRefNumber | Ukprn | PriceEpisodeIdentifier | Period | ULN   | TransactionType    | Amount   |
	| LearnRefNumber | Ukprn | PriceEpisodeIdentifier | Period | ULN   | TransactionType    | Amount   |

#Scenario:807_AC1- Non-DAS learner, is made redundant within the last 6 months of planned learning - receives full government funding for the rest of the programme 
#
#        Given the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 15000
#		#the learner is programme only non-DAS
#        
#        #And the learner is made redundant less than 6 months before the planned end date
#            
#        When an ILR file is submitted with the following data:
#            | ULN       | learner type           | start date | planned end date | actual end date | completion status | Total training price | Total training price effective date | Total assessment price | Total assessment price effective date |
