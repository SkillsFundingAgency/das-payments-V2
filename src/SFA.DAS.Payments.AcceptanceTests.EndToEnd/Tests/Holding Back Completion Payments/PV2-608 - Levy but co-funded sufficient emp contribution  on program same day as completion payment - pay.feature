Feature: Holding back completion payments - PV2-608
	As a provider,
	I want a levy learner with co-funding, where the employer has paid their 10% co-investment for the on-program element, but has not yet paid the employer completion payment element, and the final on program payment is the same day as the completion payment
	So that I am accurately paid the completion payment by SFA

Scenario Outline: Levy learner but co-funded, sufficient employer contribution, on program payment same day as completion payment - pay completion PV2-608
	Given the employer levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is 0
	
	And the following commitments exist
        | start date                | end date                     | agreed price | status |
        | 01/Jun/Last Academic Year | 01/Jun/Current Academic Year | 9000         | active |
	
	And the provider previously submitted the following learner details

#Feature: Holding back completion payments

#Maths.
#Price x 0.20 = £7,200
#£7,200 x 0.90 = £720 = Employer Contribution
#£720/12 = £60
#
#Completion payment workings:
#£9000 x 0.20 = £1,800
#£1800 x 0.90 (for co-funded) = £1620 = SFA, & £180 Employer contribution.

#We expect the employer contributions to total 720 in order for the completion payment to be released to the training provider.
