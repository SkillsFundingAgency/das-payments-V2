Feature: Holding back completion payments - PV2-499
	As a provider,
	I want a Non-levy learner, where the employer has paid all their 10% co-investment for the on-program element only, but has not yet paid the employer completion payment element
	So that I am accurately paid the completion payment by SFA

Scenario Outline: Non-Levy Learner-in co-funding completion payment made as enough employer contribution PV2-499
	Given the provider previously submitted the following learner details
		| Start Date                | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assessment Price | Total Assessment Price Effective Date | Actual Duration | Completion Status | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Framework Code | Pathway Code | Programme Type | Funding Line Type                                      | SFA Contribution Percentage |

	And the following earnings had been generated for the learner
        | Delivery Period        | On-Programme | Completion | Balancing |

#Feature: Holding back completion payments

#Scenario: AC2 - 1 learner, non levy, co-funding has been used and provider data shows enough employer contribution – pay completion

#Maths.
#Price x 0.20 = £7,200
#£7,200 x 0.90 = £720 = Employer Contribution
#£720/12 = £60
#
#Completion payment workings:
#£9000 x 0.20 = £1,800
#£1800 x 0.90 (for co-funded) = £1620 = SFA, & £180 Employer contribution.
#
#We expect the employer contributions to total 720 in order for the completion payment to be released to the training provider.
