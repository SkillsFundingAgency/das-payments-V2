Feature:  Holding Back Completion Payments - PV2-509
	As a provider,
	I want a Non levy learner, where the planned end date is the last day of month and the employer has paid their 10% co-investment for the on-program element for the first 12 months, but has not yet paid the employer completion payment element and the 13th month on program payment
	So that I am accurately paid the completion payment by SFA

Scenario: Non-Levy Learner,completion payment held back due to insufficient employer contribution - payment is released when sufficient contribution evidenced - PV2-509

	Given the provider previously submitted the following learner details in collection period "R11/Current Academic Year"

#Feature: Holding back completion payments
# 
#Scenario: AC6 - 1 learner, non-levy, co-funding has been used and provider data shows not enough employer contribution at the time completion is recorded, 
#but then another contribution is evidenced later – don’t pay completion initially, but then release completion payment when extra contribution is recorded
#
#	Given the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 9000
#
#    When an ILR file is submitted for academic year 1718 in period R11 with the following data:

#Maths.
#Price x 0.20 = £7,200
#£7,200 x 0.90 = £720 = Employer Contribution
#£720/12 = £60 
#
#Completion payment workings:
#£9000 x 0.20 = £1,800
#£1800 x 0.90 (for co-funded) = £1620 = SFA, & £180 Employer contribution.
#
#We expect the employer contributions to total 720 in order for the completion payment to be released to the training provider.
