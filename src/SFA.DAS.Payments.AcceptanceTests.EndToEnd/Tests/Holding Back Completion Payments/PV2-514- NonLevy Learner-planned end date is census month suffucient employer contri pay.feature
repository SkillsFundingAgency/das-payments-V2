Feature: Non-Levy Learner-in co-funding and planned end date is last day of month, completion payment made as enough employer contribution PV2-514
		As a provider,
		I want a Non levy learner, where the planned end date is the last day of month and the employer has paid their 10% co-investment for the on-program element for the first 12 months, but has not yet paid the employer completion payment element and the 13th month on program payment
		So that I am accurately paid the completion payment by SFA PV2-514

Scenario Outline: Non-Levy Learner-in co-funding and planned end date is last day of month, completion payment made as enough employer contribution PV2-514
	Given the provider previously submitted the following learner details
		| Start Date                | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assessment Price | Total Assessment Price Effective Date | Actual Duration | Completion Status | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Framework Code | Pathway Code | Programme Type | Funding Line Type                                      | SFA Contribution Percentage |

	And the following earnings had been generated for the learner
        | Delivery Period        | On-Programme | Completion | Balancing |
        | Aug/Last Academic Year | 0            | 0          | 0         |

        | Jul/Last Academic Year | 500          | 0          | 0         |
    And the following provider payments had been generated 
        | Collection Period      | Delivery Period        | SFA Co-Funded Payments | Employer Co-Funded Payments | Levy Payments | Transaction Type |

    But the Provider now changes the Learner details as follows

	When the amended ILR file is re-submitted for the learners in collection period <Collection_Period>
	Then the following learner earnings should be generated

#Feature: Holding back completion payments
# 
#Scenario: AC8 - 1 learner, non-levy, planned end date is last day of month, co-funding has been used and provider data shows enough employer contribution – pay completion
#
#	Given the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 9000
#
#    When an ILR file is submitted for academic year 1718 in period R11 with the following data:
#
