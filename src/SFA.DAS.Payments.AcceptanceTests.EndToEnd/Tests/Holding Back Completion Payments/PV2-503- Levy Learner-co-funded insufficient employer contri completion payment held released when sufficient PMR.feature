Feature: Holding back completion payments - PV2-503
		As a provider,
		I want a levy learner, where the employer initially pays less than the 10% co-investment for the on-program element in the month of completion, but in the following month the employer achieves the 10% co-investment, although has not yet paid the employer completion payment element
		So that I am accurately paid the completion payment by SFA 

Scenario: Levy Learner-co-funded,insufficient employer contribution, completion payment held and released when correct amount paid - PV2-503

	Given the employer levy account balance in collection period R12/Current Academic Year is 0

	And the following commitments exist
        | start date                | end date                     | agreed price | status |
        | 01/Jun/Last Academic Year | 01/Jun/Current Academic Year | 9000         | active |

	# New field in the ILR line -  Employer Contribution
