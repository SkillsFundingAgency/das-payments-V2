Feature: Levy learner- changes standard course but price is unchanged PV2-525
		As a provider,
		I want a levy learner, where the standard changes in the ILR during training, and is different to the standard submitted in the commitment and initial ILR, but the standard price remains the same
		So that I am accurately paid the apprenticeship commission

	Scenario Outline: Levy learner change to standard in ILR but no change in price PV2-525

	Given the employer levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance>

	And the following commitments exist
		| Identifier | start date                   | end date                     | status | agreed price | Standard Code | Programme Type |
		| 1          | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year | 31/Jul/Current Academic Year | active | 15000        | 51            | 25             |

	And the provider previously submitted the following learner details
        | Start Date                   | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assesment Price | Total Assesment Price Effective Date | Completion Status | SFA Contribution Percentage | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Standard Code | Programme Type | Funding Line Type                                  |
        | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year | 12 months        | 12000                | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year        | 3000                  | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year         | continuing        | 90%                         | Act1          | 1                   | ZPROG001      | 51            | 25             | 16-18 Apprenticeship (From May 2017) Levy Contract |

    And the following earnings had been generated for the learner
        | Delivery Period           | On-Programme | Completion | Balancing |
        | Aug/Current Academic Year | 1000         | 0          | 0         |

        | Jul/Current Academic Year | 1000         | 0          | 0         |

    And the following provider payments had been generated
        | Collection Period         | Delivery Period           | Levy Payments | Transaction Type |
        | R01/Current Academic Year | Aug/Current Academic Year | 1000          | Learning         |
        | R02/Current Academic Year | Sep/Current Academic Year | 1000          | Learning         |
         
    But the Commitment details are changed as follows 
		| Identifier | start date                   | end date                     | status    | agreed price | Standard Code | Programme Type |

	When the amended ILR file is re-submitted for the learners in collection period <Collection_Period>

    Then the following learner earnings should be generated
