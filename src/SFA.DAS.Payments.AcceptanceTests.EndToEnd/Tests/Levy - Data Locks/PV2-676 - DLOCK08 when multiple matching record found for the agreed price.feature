Feature:  DLOCK08 - When multiple matching record found in an employer digital account then datalock DLOCK_08 will be produced PV2-676
		As a Provider,
		I want to be notified with a DLOCK08 when multiple matching records found in an employer digital account
		So that I can correct the data mis-match between the Commitment and ILR - PV2-676

Scenario: DLOCK08 - When multiple matching record found in an employer digital account then datalock DLOCK_08 will be produced PV2-676

	Given the employer levy account balance in collection period R12/Current Academic Year is 10000
	# Multi matching records - different providers, ILR submitted by provider a
	And the following commitments exist
		| Identifier       | Provider   | LearnerId | framework code | programme type | pathway code | agreed price | start date                   | end date                  | status | effective from               |
		| Apprenticeship a | Provider a | learner 1 | 593            | 20             | 1            | 10000        | 01/May/Current Academic Year | 01/May/Next Academic Year | active | 01/May/Current Academic Year |
		| Apprenticeship b | Provider b | learner 1 | 593            | 20             | 1            | 10000        | 01/May/Current Academic Year | 01/May/Next Academic Year | active | 01/May/Current Academic Year |

	And the "Provider a" is providing training for the following learners
		| LearnerId | Start Date                   | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Completion Status | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Framework code | Programme type | Pathway code | Funding Line Type                                  | SFA Contribution Percentage |
		| learner 1 | 01/May/Current Academic Year | 12 months        | 10000                | 01/May/Current Academic Year        | continuing        | Act1          | 1                   | ZPROG001      | 593            | 20             | 1            | 16-18 Apprenticeship (From May 2017) Levy Contract | 90%                         |
    
	And price details as follows
		| Price Episode Id  | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Contract Type  | SFA Contribution Percentage | Aim Sequence Number |
		| pe-1              | 10000                | 01/May/Current Academic Year        | Act1           | 90%                         | 1                   |
	When the ILR file is submitted for the learners for collection period R12/Current Academic Year by "Provider a"
	Then the following learner earnings should be generated for "Provider a"
