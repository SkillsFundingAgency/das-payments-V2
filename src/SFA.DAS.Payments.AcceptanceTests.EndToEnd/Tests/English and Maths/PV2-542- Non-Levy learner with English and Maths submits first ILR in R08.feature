#Scenario: Non-Levy learner, provider submits first ILR in R08 showing ACT2 from the start of learning. Correct Maths or English refunds are processed
#    
#	Given the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 9000
#        
#	When an ILR file is submitted for period R08 with the following data:
#        | ULN       | learner type           | agreed price | start date | planned end date | actual end date | completion status | aim type         | aim sequence number | aim rate | framework code | programme type | pathway code | contract type | contract type date from |
