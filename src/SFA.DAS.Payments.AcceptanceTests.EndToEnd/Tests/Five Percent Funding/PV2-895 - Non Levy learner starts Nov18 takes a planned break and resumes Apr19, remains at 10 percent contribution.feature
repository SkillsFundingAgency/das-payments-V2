Feature: 5% Contribution from April 2019 PV2-895
As a provider,
I want a Non Levy learner, starting prior to Apr 2019, taking a planned break and resuming from Apr 2019, where completion payment remains at 10% contribution
So that I am paid the correct apprenticeship funding by SFA

Scenario Outline: Non Levy Learner, started learning before Apr19, has planned break and resumes learning from Apr19, remains on 10% contribution PV2 -895
    Given the provider previously submitted the following learner details
        | Start Date                   | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assessment Price | Total Assessment Price Effective Date | Actual Duration | Completion Status | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Standard Code | Programme Type | Funding Line Type                                                     | SFA Contribution Percentage |
