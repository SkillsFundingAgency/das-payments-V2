Feature: 5% Contribution from April 2019 PV2-905
As a provider,
I want a Levy learner, starting prior to Apr 2019, where learner completes learning and starts a new course on new Pathway code in Apr 2019, and moves into co-funding on 5% contribution
So that I am paid the correct apprenticeship funding by SFA

Scenario Outline: Levy Learner, started learning before Apr19, completes learning and starts new course on new pathway code from Apr19, moves into co-funding and second pathway code on 5% contribution PV2-905

Given the employer levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance>
		
	And the following apprenticeships exist
		| Framework code | programme type | pathway code | agreed price | start date                   | end date                     | status    | effective from               |
