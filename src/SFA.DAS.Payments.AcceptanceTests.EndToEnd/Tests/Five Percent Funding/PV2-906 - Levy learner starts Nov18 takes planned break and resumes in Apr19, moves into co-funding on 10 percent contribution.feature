Feature: 5% Contribution from April 2019 PV2-906
As a provider,
I want a Levy learner, starting prior to Apr 2019, where learner takes a planned break and resumes in Apr 2019, and moves into co-funding on 10% contribution
So that I am paid the correct apprenticeship funding by SFA

Scenario Outline: Levy Learner, started learning before Apr19 with Levy balance, takes a planned break and resumes from Apr19, moves into co-funding on 10% contribution PV2-906

Given the employer levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance>
		
And the following apprenticeships exist
	| Standard code | programme type | agreed price | start date                   | end date                  | status        | effective from               |

And the provider previously submitted the following learner details
    | Start Date                   | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assessment Price | Total Assessment Price Effective Date | Actual Duration | Completion Status | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Standard Code | Programme Type | Aim Reference | Funding Line Type                                  | SFA Contribution Percentage |
