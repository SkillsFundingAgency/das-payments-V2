Feature: Non-levy Learner over funding band cap - PV2-529
	As a provider,
	I want a Non-levy learner, where the negotiated total price for the learner is more than the maximum allowed for that funding band
	So that I am only paid up to the maximum cap within that funding band by SFA

#Scenario: Payment for a non-DAS learner with a negotiated price above the funding band cap
#    
#	Given the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 15000
#    When an ILR file is submitted with the following data:
#	
#        | Provider   | ULN       | learner type           | agreed price | start date | planned end date | actual end date | completion status | standard code |
#        | provider a | learner a | programme only non-DAS | 18000        | 06/08/2018 | 08/08/2019       |                 | continuing        | 50            |
#		
#    Then the following capping will apply to the price episodes:
#        | Provider   | price episode | negotiated price | funding cap | previous funding paid | price above cap | effective price for SFA payments |
#        | provider a | 08/18 onwards | 18000            | 15000       | 0                     | 3000            | 15000                            |
#		
#    And the provider earnings and payments break down as follows:
