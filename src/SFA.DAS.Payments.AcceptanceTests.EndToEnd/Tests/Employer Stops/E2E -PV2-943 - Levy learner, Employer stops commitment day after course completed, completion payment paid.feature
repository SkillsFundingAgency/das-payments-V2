#Feature: Employer Stops
#
#Scenario: Employer stops commitment after the day that the course is completed, but in the same month. Completion payment to be paid
#  
#  Given the learner is programme only Levy
#  And levy balance > agreed price for all months
#  
#  And the following commitments exist:
#        | commitment Id | version Id | ULN       | start date | end date   | status    | agreed price | effective from | effective to | stop effective from |
#        | 1             | 1          | learner a | 01/08/2018 | 01/09/2019 | cancelled | 15000        | 01/08/2018     | 01/09/2019   | 15/08/2019          |
#            
#  When an ILR file is submitted with the following data:
#        | ULN       | agreed price | learner type       | start date | planned end date | actual end date   |completion status|
#        | learner a | 15000        | programme only DAS | 01/08/2018 | 09/08/2019       | 09/08/2019        |completed        |
#  
#  Then the provider earnings and payments break down as follows:
#        | Type                           | 08/18 | 09/19 | ... | 07/19 | 08/19 | 09/19 |
