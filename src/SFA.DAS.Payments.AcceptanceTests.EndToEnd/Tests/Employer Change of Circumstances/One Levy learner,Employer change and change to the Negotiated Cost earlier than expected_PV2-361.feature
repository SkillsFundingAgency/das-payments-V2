Feature: One Levy learner changes employer with change to negotiated price earlier than expected PV2-361
Change in employer and change in negotiated price in mid-month
As a provider,
I want earnings and payments for a levy learner, levy available, and there is a change to the Negotiated Cost earlier than expected to be paid the correct amount
So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.

Scenario Outline: Levy learner changes employer with change to negotiated price earlier than expected PV2-361
Given the "employer 1" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 1>
And  the "employer 2" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 2>
And the following commitments exist 
		| Identifier              | Employer   | start date                   | end date                     | agreed price | status    | effective from               | effective to                 | stop effective from          |
		| Apprenticeship 1         | employer 1 | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year | 31/Jul/Current Academic Year | 15000        | cancelled | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year | 31/Oct/Current Academic Year | 01/Nov/Current Academic Year |  
		| Apprenticeship 2         | employer 2 | 01/Nov/Current Academic Year | 31/Jul/Current Academic Year | 5625         | active    | 01/Nov/Current Academic Year |                              |                              |

And the provider previously submitted the following learner details
	| Start Date                   | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assessment Price | Total Assessment Price Effective Date | Actual Duration | Completion Status | SFA Contribution Percentage | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Standard Code | Programme Type | Funding Line Type                                  |
	| 04/Aug/Current Academic Year | 12 months        | 12000                | 04/Aug/Current Academic Year        | 3000                   | 04/Aug/Current Academic Year          |                 | continuing        | 90%                         | Act1          | 1                   | ZPROG001      | 51            | 25             | 16-18 Apprenticeship (From May 2017) Levy Contract |

And the following earnings had been generated for the learner
    | Delivery Period           | On-Programme | Completion | Balancing |
    | Aug/Current Academic Year | 1000         | 0          | 0         |

    | Jul/Current Academic Year | 1000         | 0          | 0         |

And the following provider payments had been generated
    | Collection Period         | Delivery Period           | Levy Payments | Transaction Type | Employer   |
    | R01/Current Academic Year | Aug/Current Academic Year | 1000          | Learning         | employer 1 |
    | R02/Current Academic Year | Sep/Current Academic Year | 1000          | Learning         | employer 1 |
 
But the Provider now changes the Learner details as follows
	| Start Date                   | Planned Duration | Actual Duration | Completion Status | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Standard Code | Programme Type | Funding Line Type                                  |

And price details as follows
	| Price Episode Id | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assessment Price | Total Assessment Price Effective Date | Residual Training Price | Residual Training Price Effective Date | Residual Assessment Price | Residual Assessment Price Effective Date | SFA Contribution Percentage | Contract Type |
	| pe-1             | 12000                | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year        | 3000                   | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year          | 0                       |                                        | 0                         |                                          | 90%                         | Act1          |

When the amended ILR file is re-submitted for the learners in collection period <Collection_Period>
	
Then the following learner earnings should be generated
	| Delivery Period           | On-Programme | Completion | Balancing | Price Episode Identifier |

And Month end is triggered
And no provider payments will be recorded
And no provider payments will be generated
