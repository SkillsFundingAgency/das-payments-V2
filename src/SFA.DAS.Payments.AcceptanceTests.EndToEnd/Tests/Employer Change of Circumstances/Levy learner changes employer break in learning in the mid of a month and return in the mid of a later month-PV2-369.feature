Feature: Levy learner changes employer break in learning in the mid of a month and return in the mid of a later month-PV2-369
		As a provider,
		I want earnings and payments for a levy learner, levy available, and they have a break in learning in the middle of a month and return in the middle of a later month with a different employer, to be paid the correct amount
		So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.

	Given the "employer 1" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 1>
	And  the "employer 2" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 2>
	And the following commitments exist
