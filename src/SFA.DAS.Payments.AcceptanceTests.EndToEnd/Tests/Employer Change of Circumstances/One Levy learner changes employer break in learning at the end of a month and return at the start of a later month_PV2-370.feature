Feature: One Levy learner changes employer after break in learning at the end of a month and return at the start of a later month PV2-370
		As a provider,
		I want earnings and payments for a levy learner, levy available, and they have a break in learning in the middle of a month and return in the middle of a later month with a different employer - before the second commitment is in place, to be paid the correct amount
		So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.

Scenario Outline: One Levy learner changes employer after break in learning at the end of a month and return at the start of a later month PV2-370
	Given the "employer 1" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 1>
	And  the "employer 2" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 2>
	And the following commitments exist
	   | Identifier          | Employer   | start date                   | end date                  | agreed price | status    | effective from               | effective to                 | stop effective from          |
	   | Apprenticeship 1     | employer 1 | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year | 31/Aug/Next Academic Year | 15000        | cancelled | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year | 31/Oct/Current Academic Year | 01/Nov/Current Academic Year |
	   | Apprenticeship 2     | employer 2 | 01/Jan/Current Academic Year | 31/Oct/Next Academic Year | 5625         | active    | 01/Jan/Current Academic Year |                              |                              |
	And the provider previously submitted the following learner details
		| Start Date                   | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assessment Price | Total Assessment Price Effective Date | Actual Duration | Completion Status | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Standard Code | Programme Type | Funding Line Type                                  | SFA Contribution Percentage |

    And the following earnings had been generated for the learner
        | Delivery Period           | On-Programme | Completion | Balancing |

		| Jul/Current Academic Year | 1000         | 0          | 0         |
    And the following provider payments had been generated
        | Collection Period         | Delivery Period           | Levy Payments | Transaction Type | Employer   |
        | R01/Current Academic Year | Aug/Current Academic Year | 1000          | Learning         | employer 1 |

        | R03/Current Academic Year | Oct/Current Academic Year | 1000          | Learning         | employer 1 |
    But the Provider now changes the Learner details as follows
		| Start Date                   | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assessment Price | Total Assessment Price Effective Date | Actual Duration | Completion Status | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Standard Code | Programme Type | Funding Line Type                                  |

	When the amended ILR file is re-submitted for the learners in collection period <Collection_Period>
	Then the following learner earnings should be generated
		| Delivery Period           | On-Programme | Completion | Balancing | Price Episode Identifier |

    And Month end is triggered
 	And no provider payments will be recorded
	And no provider payments will be generated
