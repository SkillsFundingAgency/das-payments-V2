Feature: Levy learner changes employer with change to negotiated price in mid month PV2-363
		As a provider,
		I want earnings and payments for a levy learner, levy available, commitment entered for a new employer in the middle of the month, and there is a change to the employer and negotiated cost in the middle of a month in the ILR, to be paid the correct amount
		So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.
