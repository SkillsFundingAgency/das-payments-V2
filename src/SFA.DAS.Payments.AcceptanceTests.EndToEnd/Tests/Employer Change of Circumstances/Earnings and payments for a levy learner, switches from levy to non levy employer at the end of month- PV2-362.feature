Feature: Earnings and payments for a levy learner, switches from levy to non levy employer at the end of month- PV2-362
As a provider,
I want earnings and payments for a levy learner, levy available, where a learner switches from levy to non-levy employer at the end of month, to be paid the correct amount
So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.

Scenario Outline: Earnings and payments for a levy learner, switches from levy to non levy employer at the end of month- PV2-362
Given the "employer 1" levy account balance in collection period R01/Current Academic Year is 15000
And the following commitments exist 
	| Employer   | start date                   | end date                     | agreed price | status | effective from            | effective to |
	| employer 1 | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year | 04/Aug/Current Academic Year | 15000        | active | 01/Aug/Last Academic Year |              |

And the provider previously submitted the following learner details
	| Start Date                   | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assessment Price | Total Assessment Price Effective Date | Actual Duration | Completion Status | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Standard Code | Programme Type | Funding Line Type                                  | SFA Contribution Percentage |

And the following earnings had been generated for the learner

	| Jul/Current Academic Year | 1000         | 0          | 0         |

And the following provider payments had been generated

	| R03/Current Academic Year | Oct/Current Academic Year | 1000          | Learning         | employer 1 |
