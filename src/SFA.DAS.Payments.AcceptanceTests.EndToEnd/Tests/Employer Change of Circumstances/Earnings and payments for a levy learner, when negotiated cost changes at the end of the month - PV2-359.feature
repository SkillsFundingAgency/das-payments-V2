#standard code changes here and the aim is regarded as removed from ILR but it is just a new aim added to ILR, the spec needs updating to new format where we can supply both aims
Feature: Earnings and payments for a levy learner when the negotiated price changes at the end of the month PV2-359
As a provider,
I want earnings and payments for a levy learner, levy available, and there is a change to the Negotiated Cost which happens at the end of the month to be paid the correct amount
So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.

#Feature: Provider earnings and payments where learner changes apprenticeship standard or there is a change to the negotiated price at the end of a month, remaining with the same employer and provider
#
#    Background:
