Feature: One Levy learner changes provider earns incentive in the commitment transfer month and ILR transfer happens in a later month PV2-321
	1 learner aged 16-18, levy available, changes provider, earns incentive payment in the commitment transfer month - and the ILR transfer happens in a later month 
	As a provider,
	I want a levy learner, aged 16-18 levy available, changes provider, earns incentive payment in the transfer month - ILR transfer happens in a later month to be paid the correct amount
	So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.

Scenario Outline: One Levy learner changes provider earns incentive in the commitment transfer month and ILR transfer happens in a later month PV2-321
	Given the employer levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance>
	And the following commitments exist

#Scenario: 1 learner aged 16-18, levy available, changes provider, earns incentive payment in the commitment transfer month - and the ILR transfer happens in a later month  
#    
#        Given levy balance > agreed price for all months
#		And the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 15000
#        And the following commitments exist:
#            | commitment Id | version Id | Provider   | ULN       | start date | end date   | agreed price | status    | effective from | effective to | stop effective from |

#        When the providers submit the following ILR files:
