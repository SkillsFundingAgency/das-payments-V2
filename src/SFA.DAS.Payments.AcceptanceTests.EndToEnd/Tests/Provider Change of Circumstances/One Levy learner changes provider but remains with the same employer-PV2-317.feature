Feature: One Levy learner changes provider but remains with the same employer-PV2-317
	As a provider,
	I want a levy learner, that changes provider but remains with the same employer, to be paid the correct amount
	So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.

Scenario Outline: Levy learner changes provider but remains with the same employer PV2-317
	Given the employer levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance>
	And the "provider a" previously submitted the following learner details

    And the following commitments exist

        | Aug/Current Academic Year | 500          | 0          | 0         |

        | Jul/Current Academic Year | 500          | 0          | 0         |
    And the following "provider a" payments had been generated

        | R07/Current Academic Year | Feb/Current Academic Year | 500           | Learning         |

	When the amended ILR file is re-submitted for the learners in the collection period <Collection_Period> by "provider a"
	When the ILR file is submitted for the learners for the collection period <Collection_Period> by "provider b"

	Then the following learner earnings should be generated for "provider a"
