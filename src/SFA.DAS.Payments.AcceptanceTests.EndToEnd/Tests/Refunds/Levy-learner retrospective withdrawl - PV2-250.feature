Feature: Levy Learner is withdrawn retrospectively PV2-250
	As a provider,
	I want a levy learner, where levy is available the provider retrospectively notifies a withdrawal and previously paid monthly instalments are refunded
	So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.

Scenario:  Provider retrospectively notifies of a withdrawal for a levy learner after payments have already been made PV2-250

Given the employer levy account balance in collection period R06/Current Academic Year is 15000

And the following commitments exist

	| start date                   | end date                     | agreed price |Standard Code | Programme Type |
