#Feature: The ILR is submitted late (after the academic year boundary)
#
#Scenario: ILR submitted late for a DAS learner, levy available
#		
#Given the apprenticeship funding band maximum for each learner is 17000
#And levy balance > agreed price for all months
#When a provider submits an ILR several months after learning has started (but before the academic year boundary), 
#the earnings calculation is updated retrospectively and the provider gets paid for the preceding months.
#	
#
#		Given the following commitments exist:
#		
#            | ULN       | priority | start date | end date   | agreed price |
#            | learner a | 1        | 01/09/2018 | 08/09/2019 | 15000        |
#        
#		When an ILR file is submitted for the first time on 28/0 with the following data:
#		
#            | ULN       | learner type       | agreed price | start date | planned end date | completion status |
