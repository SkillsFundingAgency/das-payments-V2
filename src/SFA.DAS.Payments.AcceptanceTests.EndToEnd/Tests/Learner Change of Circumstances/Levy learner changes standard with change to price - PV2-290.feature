#Background:
#        Given The learner is programme only DAS
#        And the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 17000
#        And levy balance > agreed price for all months
#
#    Scenario: Earnings and payments for a DAS learner, levy available, where the apprenticeship standard changes
#        Given the following commitments exist on 03/12/2018:
#            | commitment Id | version Id | ULN       | standard code | start date | end date   | agreed price | effective from | effective to |
#            | 1             | 1-001      | learner a | 51            | 01/08/2018 | 01/08/2019 | 15000        | 01/08/2018     | 31/10/2018   |

#        When an ILR file is submitted with the following data:
#            | ULN       | standard code | start date | planned end date | actual end date | completion status | Total training price | Total training price effective date | Total assessment price | Total assessment price effective date |

#        #Then the data lock status of the ILR in 03/12/2018 is:
#        #    | Payment type | 08/18               | 09/18               | 10/18               | 11/18               | 12/18               |

#        Then the provider earnings and payments break down as follows:
