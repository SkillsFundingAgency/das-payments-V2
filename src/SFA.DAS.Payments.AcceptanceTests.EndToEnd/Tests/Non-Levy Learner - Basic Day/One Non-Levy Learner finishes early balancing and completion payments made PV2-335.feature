#Feature: Provider earnings and payments where learner completes earlier than planned
#
#    The earnings and payment rules for early completions are the same as for learners finishing on time, except that the completion payment is earned earlier.
#
#    Background:
#        Given the apprenticeship funding band maximum for each learner is 20000
#        
#        Scenario: A non-DAS learner, learner finishes early
#        When an ILR file is submitted with the following data:
#            | ULN       | learner type           | agreed price | start date | planned end date | actual end date | completion status |
