Feature: One Non-Levy Learner submitted late PV2-427
	As a provider,
	I want to ensure that when a non-levy learner is submitted for the first time in R13/R14 that payments are calculated correctly.
	So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.

Scenario: ILR submitted first time in R13 or R14 for a non-DAS learner ILR PV2-427
    Given the provider is providing training for the following learners
        | Start Date                   | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assessment Price | Total Assessment Price Effective Date | Actual Duration | Completion Status | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Framework Code | Pathway Code | Programme Type | Funding Line Type                                                     | SFA Contribution Percentage |
        | 01/Sep/Current Academic Year | 12 months        | 15000                | 01/Sep/Current Academic Year        | 0                      | 01/Sep/Current Academic Year          |                 | continuing        | Act2          | 1                   | ZPROG001      | 403            | 1            | 25             | 16-18 Apprenticeship (From May 2017) Non-Levy Contract (non-procured) | 90%                         |
	When the ILR file is submitted for the learners for collection period R13/Current Academic Year
	Then the following learner earnings should be generated
