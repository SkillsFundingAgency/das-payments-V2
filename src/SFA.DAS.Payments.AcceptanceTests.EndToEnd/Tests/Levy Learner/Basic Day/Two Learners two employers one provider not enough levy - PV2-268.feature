Feature: Two Learners two employers one provider not enough levy - PV2-268
	As a provider,
	I want 2 learners with 2 employers that have 1 provider and there is not enough levy to be paid the correct amount
	So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.

Scenario Outline: 2 levy learners 2 employers 1 provider not enough levy PV2-268
	# levy balance is not enough for both employers
	Given the "employer 1" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 1>
	And  the "employer 2" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 2>

#Scenario: 2 learners, 2 employers, 1 provider - not enough levy

# Given the employer 1 has a levy balance of:
#            | 10/18 | 11/18 | 12/18 | ... | 09/19 | 10/19 |
#            | 0     | 100   | 100   | 100 | 250   | 500   |
# 
# And the employer 2 has a levy balance of:
#            | 10/18 | 11/18 | 12/18 | ... | 09/19 | 10/19 |
#            | 500   | 500   | 500   | 500 | 500   | 1500  |
#   
# And the following commitments exist:
#            | Employer   | ULN       | priority | agreed price | start date | end date   |
#            | employer 1 | learner a | 1        | 7500         | 01/09/2018 | 08/09/2019 |
#            | employer 2 | learner b | 1        | 15000        | 01/09/2018 | 08/09/2019 |
#        
#
#When an ILR file is submitted with the following data:
#            | ULN       | agreed price | learner type       | start date | planned end date | actual end date | completion status |
#            | learner a | 7500         | programme only DAS | 01/09/2018 | 08/09/2019       | 08/09/2019      | completed         |
#            | learner b | 15000        | programme only DAS | 01/09/2018 | 08/09/2019       | 08/09/2019      | completed         |

#Then the provider earnings and payments break down as follows:
