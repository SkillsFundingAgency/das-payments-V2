Feature: One Levy learner - levy available, finishes one month early PV2-275
	As a provider,
	I want a levy learner, where levy is available and the learner finishes one month early to be paid the correct amount
	So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.

Scenario Outline: One levy learner, levy available, finishes one month early PV2-275
	# levy balance > agreed price for all months
	Given the employer levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance>
	And the following commitments exist
        | start date                | end date                     | agreed price |
        | 01/Sep/Last Academic Year | 08/Sep/Current Academic Year | 15000        |
	And the provider previously submitted the following learner details
		| Start Date                | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assessment Price | Total Assessment Price Effective Date | Actual Duration | Completion Status | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Framework Code | Pathway Code | Programme Type | Funding Line Type                                | SFA Contribution Percentage |

    And the following earnings had been generated for the learner
        | Delivery Period        | On-Programme | Completion | Balancing |
        | Aug/Last Academic Year | 0            | 0          | 0         |

        | Jul/Last Academic Year | 1000         | 0          | 0         |
    And the following provider payments had been generated
        | Collection Period      | Delivery Period        | Levy Payments | Transaction Type |
        | R02/Last Academic Year | Sep/Last Academic Year | 1000          | Learning         |
        | R03/Last Academic Year | Oct/Last Academic Year | 1000          | Learning         |
        | R04/Last Academic Year | Nov/Last Academic Year | 1000          | Learning         |

        | R12/Last Academic Year | Jul/Last Academic Year | 1000          | Learning         |
    But the Provider now changes the Learner details as follows
		| Start Date                | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assessment Price | Total Assessment Price Effective Date | Actual Duration | Completion Status | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Framework Code | Pathway Code | Programme Type | Funding Line Type                                | SFA Contribution Percentage |

	When the amended ILR file is re-submitted for the learners in collection period <Collection_Period>
	Then the following learner earnings should be generated
		| Delivery Period           | On-Programme | Completion | Balancing |
		| Aug/Current Academic Year | 0            | 3000       | 1000      |

		| Jul/Current Academic Year | 0            | 0          | 0         |
    And at month end only the following payments will be calculated
