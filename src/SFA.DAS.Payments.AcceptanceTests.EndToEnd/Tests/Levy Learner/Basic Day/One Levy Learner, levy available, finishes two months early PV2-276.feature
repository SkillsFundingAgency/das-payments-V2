Feature: One Levy learner - levy available, finishes two months early PV2-276
	As a provider,
	I want a levy learner, where levy is available and the learner finishes two months early to be paid the correct amount
	So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.
Scenario Outline: One levy learner, levy available, learner finishes two months early PV2-276
	# levy balance > agreed price for all months
	Given the employer levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance>
	And the following commitments exist
        | start date                | end date                     | agreed price |
        | 01/Sep/Current Academic Year | 08/Sep/Next Academic Year | 15000        |
	And the provider previously submitted the following learner details

    And the following earnings had been generated for the learner

        | Jul/Current Academic Year | 1000         | 0          | 0         |
    And the following provider payments had been generated
        | Collection Period         | Delivery Period           | Levy Payments | Transaction Type |
        | R02/Current Academic Year | Sep/Current Academic Year | 1000          | Learning         |

        | R11/Current Academic Year | Jun/Current Academic Year | 1000          | Learning         |
    But the Provider now changes the Learner details as follows

	When the amended ILR file is re-submitted for the learners in collection period <Collection_Period>
	Then the following learner earnings should be generated
		| Delivery Period           | On-Programme | Completion | Balancing |

		| Jul/Current Academic Year | 0            | 3000       | 2000      |
    And at month end only the following payments will be calculated
