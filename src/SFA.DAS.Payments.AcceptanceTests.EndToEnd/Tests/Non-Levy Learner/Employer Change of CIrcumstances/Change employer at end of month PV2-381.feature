Feature: Change employer at end of month PV2-381
	As a provider,
	I want earnings and payments for a non-levy learner, and there is a change to the Negotiated Cost which happens at the end of the month, to be paid the correct amount
	So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.

#Feature: Non-levy learner changes employer with change to negotiated price at the end of month
#And the employment status in the ILR is
#| Employer   | Employment Status  | Employment Status Applies    | Small Employer |
#| employer 1 | in paid employment | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year |                |
#| employer 2 | in paid employment | 01/Nov/Current Academic Year |                |

# Differences from 255 
# "price details as follows" has additional residual fields
