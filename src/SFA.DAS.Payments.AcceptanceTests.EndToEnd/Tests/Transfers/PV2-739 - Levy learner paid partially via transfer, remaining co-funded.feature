Feature: Transfers - PV2-739 Single Levy learner paid partially via transfer, remaining co-funded
		As a provider,
		I want a Levy learner, where the employer receives a transfer from another employer to fund the learner, but not enough transfer funds are available and receiving employer doesn't have their own Levy, so co-funded
		So that I am accurately paid the apprenticeship amount by SFA - PV2-739

Scenario Outline: Transfers - Single Levy learner partially paid via transfer - PV2-739

	Given the "employer 1" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 1>
	And the "employer 2" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 2>
	And the remaining transfer allowance for "employer 2" is <Employer 2 Remaining Transfer Allowance>
	#And a transfer agreement has been set up between employer 1 and employer 2

	And the following apprenticeships exist 
		| Employer   | Sending Employer | Start Date                   | End Date                  | Agreed Price | Standard Code | Programme Type | Status | Effective From               |
		| employer 1 | employer 2       | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year | 06/Aug/Next Academic Year | 15000        | 50            | 25             | active | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year |

    And the provider is providing training for the following learners
		| Start Date                   | Planned Duration | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Total Assessment Price | Total Assessment Price Effective Date | Actual Duration | Completion Status | Contract Type | Aim Sequence Number | Aim Reference | Standard Code | Programme Type | Funding Line Type                                  | SFA Contribution Percentage |
		| 06/Aug/Current Academic Year | 12 months        | 15000                | 06/Aug/Current Academic Year        | 0                      | 06/Aug/Current Academic Year          |                 | continuing        | Act1          | 1                   | ZPROG001      | 50            | 25             | 16-18 Apprenticeship (From May 2017) Levy Contract | 90%                         |

	And price details as follows
		| Price Episode Id | Total Training Price | Total Training Price Effective Date | Contract Type | SFA Contribution Percentage |
		| pe-1             | 15000                | 01/Aug/Current Academic Year        | Act1          | 90%                         |

	When the ILR file is submitted for the learners for collection period <Collection_Period>
	Then the following learner earnings should be generated

#Feature: Transfers
#
#Scenario: 1 learner, not enough transfer funds to cover the learner, receiver doesn't have own Levy funds so co-funded
#	
#    Given The learner is programme only DAS
#	And a transfer agreement has been set up between employer a and employer b 
#	And employer b's transfer allowance = 400 for all months
#	And employer a's levy balance = 0 for all months
#	And the apprenticeship funding band maximum is 15000
#	
#	And the following commitments exist:
#	
#		| employer of apprentice | employer paying for training | ULN       | start date | end date   | standard code | agreed price | status     | effective from | effective to |
#		| employer a             | employer b                   | learner a | 01/05/2018 | 06/05/2019 | 50            | 15000        | continuing | 01/05/2018     |   		      |
