Feature: Transfers - PV2-736 Single Levy learner paid via transfer
	As a provider,
	I want a Levy learner, where the employer receives a transfer from another employer to fund the learner
	So that I am accurately paid the apprenticeship amount by SFA via a transfer - PV2-736

Scenario Outline: Transfers - PV2-736 - Single Levy learner paid via transfer

	Given the "employer 1" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 1>
	And  the "employer 2" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 2> 
	And the remaining transfer allowance for "employer 2" is <Employer 2 Remaining Transfer Allowance>

	#And a transfer agreement has been set up between employer 1 and employer 2

	And the following apprenticeships exist
		| Employer   | Sending Employer | Start Date                   | End Date                  | Agreed price | Standard Code | Status | effective from               | programme type |
