Feature: Transfers - PV2-733 Two Levy learners paid via transfer but later one deleted, sender gets refund
	As a provider,
	I want a Levy learner, where the employer receives a transfer from another employer to fund the learner, and 1 learner is then deleted
	So that I am not paid for the deleted learner by SFA via a transfer - PV2-733

Scenario Outline: Transfers - Two Levy learners paid via transfer but later one deleted, sender gets refund - PV2-733

	Given the "employer 1" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 1>
	And the "employer 2" levy account balance in collection period <Collection_Period> is <Levy Balance for employer 2>
	And the remaining transfer allowance for "employer 2" is <Employer 2 Remaining Transfer Allowance>
	#And a transfer agreement has been set up between employer 1 and employer 2

	And the following apprenticeships exist
